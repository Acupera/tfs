## Getting Started

> If you're a NodeJS developer whishing to use it as a dependency,
> there is a module exposing all commands and described in the

## Get more information about each command

Since `tfs` is a wrapper, it only check and execute commands via `TF.exe` command line tool. So to know how to use each command, just check the [**Tf Command-Line Utility Commands** official documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z51z7zy0.aspx).

Also don't hesitate to use the `help` command, i.e. :

    tfs [cmd] -h, --help

Or :

    tfs help [cmd]

## Options:

      -h, --help  output usage information

### Good to know

> For `[itemspec]` commands :
> - If you omit `[itemspec]`, it will apply on the current directory.
> - You can use a relative, an absolute or a TFS path.
> - You can give multiple files/directories separated by a space.

## NodeJS API

You can install **tfs** as a dependency for your NodeJS projects :

    npm install tfs --save

### Usage example

To execute recursively get latest files within D:\MyBranch\MyProject,
admitting that this project is source-versionned via TFS,
you could write the following code :

    var tfs = require('tfs');

    tfs('get', 'D:/MyProject/MyBranch D:/MyOtherProject/MyOtherBranch', {
      recursive: true
    })

If you prefer to use the current directory, you can ommit the second parameter or set it to null.
